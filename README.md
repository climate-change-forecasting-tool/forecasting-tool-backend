For running locally and to be able to create the disaster dataset on your own, ensure that you create a folder in the top level called `data` containing the folder `pend-gdis-1960-2018-disasterlocations-gdb` (which contains both `pend-gdis-1960-2018-disasterlocations.gdb` and `pend-gdis-1960-2018-codebook.pdf`) and the file `emdat_disasterdata.xlsx` and the file `ne_10m_land`.

Modify the values of variables in `config.py` to configure the script's most important parameters.

Ensure that you run `app.py` to run the script.
